ABSTRACT
This project is based on staking and unstaking ERC20 tokens . A user can stake his
tokens such as WETH,FAU and DAPP and as a reward for depositing his tokens into
our TokenFarm smart contract the user will be given DAPP token . The Value of
Rewarded Dapp tokens will be same as the value of Tokens which were staked. Token
Farm smart contract allows users to stake and un-stake a specified ERC20 token. Staked
tokens are locked for a specific length of time (set by the contract owner at the outset).
Once the time period has elapsed, the user can remove their tokens again. Metamask
wallet is used for all the token transections. To deposit ETH or ERC-20 tokens to your
Metamask wallet from an exchange or another wallet, you will simply need to submit
a transaction pointed to the address of one of your accounts in MetaMask.
We have three main reasons for what make sense a blockchain offers the possibility of
staking. The first one is that on staking tokens in a smart contract you lend your liquidity
(token's value) for financial activities which generate returns (lending, insurance,
broker) with the purpose of receiving part of the generated income. The second is that,
in some cases, the blockchain protocols offers to the staking token holders the voting
rights in the network and protocol update proposals. The third one is that the blockchain
can put the tokens to work in its favour.
